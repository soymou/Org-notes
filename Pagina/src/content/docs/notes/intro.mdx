Welcome to your new Org-mode notebook. 

This site is powered by **Astro Starlight** and automatically converts your `.org` files into searchable, beautiful documentation.

### How it works
1.  Write notes in the `org/` folder.
2.  The build script converts them to MDX.
3.  Starlight renders them here.

$$
\mathcal{F}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt
$$
